# Werewolf phone game
Mobile apps are great, but not everyone has a mobile phone to install them. To stay connected and still enjoy playing games, we came up with the idea of turning the Werewolf board game into a murder-mystery–themed project. Players can simply call the number +1 507 650 6769, and provide input using the device’s number pad.

We wish you all a lot of fun!
## Note
The project is currently relatively unstable :-)
